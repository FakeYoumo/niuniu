# Context

In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), the **Kakutani fixed-point theorem** is a [fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_theorem) for [set-valued functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-valued_function). It provides [sufficient conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_condition) for a set-valued function defined on a [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set), [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_set) subset of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) to have a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)), i.e. a point which is [mapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)) to a set containing it. The Kakutani fixed point theorem is a generalization of the [Brouwer fixed point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed_point_theorem). The Brouwer fixed point theorem is a fundamental result in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) which proves the existence of fixed points for [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology)) defined on compact, convex subsets of Euclidean spaces. Kakutani's theorem extends this to set-valued functions.

The theorem was developed by [Shizuo Kakutani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizuo_Kakutani) in 1941,[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem#cite_note-kakutani-1) and was used by [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.) in his description of [Nash equilibria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).[^(\[2\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem#cite_note-nash-2) It has subsequently found widespread application in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics).[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem#cite_note-3)

# Anecdote

In his game theory textbook,[^(\[12\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem#cite_note-12) [Ken Binmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Binmore) recalls that Kakutani once asked him at a conference why so many economists had attended his talk. When Binmore told him that it was probably because of the Kakutani fixed point theorem, Kakutani was puzzled and replied, "What is the Kakutani fixed point theorem?"
