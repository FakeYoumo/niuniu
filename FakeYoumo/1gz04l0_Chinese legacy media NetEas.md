Chinese legacy media NetEase spreads history propaganda, encouraging hatreds towards reputable attorney Luo Xiang   
In this article, Chinese influencers are encouraging extreme nationalism, actively suppressing his freedom of speech by spreading history propaganda.  

Professor Luo was forced to delete his speech, but numberous videos mocking him, are available online. It is a perfect example on how the Chinese history propaganda works in practical. Chinese government delete the honest words which speaks of the truth, only keeping propaganda, aiming to spread false information about minorities. Same thing happened to Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
