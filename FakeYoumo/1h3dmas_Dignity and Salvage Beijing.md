Dignity and Salvage Beijing Restaurant (Written in both English and Chinese) Cover Letter  
In the first month, right after I arrived in Suizhou, Hubei Province, China, two suicidal people jumped from the building in my neighborhood. It was an old woman and a high school girl.


What I've heard, was that the old woman was elder abused by her son-in-law and she couldn't take it anymore. The high school girl was under too much pressure from her school and her family.


In the second month, on my way to the grocery store, a young man stabbed an old man in his face. Blood was spraying all over, the old man was crying desperately.


Not a single passerby paid attention to him, not even the security guards at the entrance of the hospital in front of the old guy.


It was me who called the police, but my aunty and grandma told me that I should stay out of it, saying I'd cause trouble for calling the police.


In the third month, a freaking little Chinese fellow took my iPad without asking me, then broke the screen. I went to the kitchen and got a meat cleaver, scared the shit out of the little cutie.


In the fourth month, I bought an electric scooter from Chinese Temu for grocery shopping. On my way back home, it blew up.


In the fifth month, I finally got a chance to visit Chinatown to try some local specialties. I got bacteria infection from the food and almost shat my guts out.


In the sixth month, I traveled for hours by bus to the countryside. It has no running water, no bath, no internet, no toilet, no gas, no consistent power supply.


Each day I shat in a shithole and ate pig feed like a piggy. Each time I passed by the living room, I stared into the eyes of Mao Zedong, which was hanging on wall. I had to listen to the uneducated farmers bragging about themselves. It was torturous to me.


In the seventh month, Police came to visit, had me install the "Fraud detection" app, had me sign the paperwork, and took photos of me.


In the eighth month, I was safe, gonna archive it.


In the ninth month, my aunt's son got slapped in the ear by his uncle. He is deaf now. His uncle was sentenced for three years.


In the tenth month, I bought a cake for my birthday party and invited people over for dinner. A freaking little Chinese fellow smashed my cake without asking me.


In the eleventh month, freaking scumbag peasant! YOU broke the law by driving against the traffic. How shameful are you, trying to blackmail ME, asking ME for money, you san ling liu (a Taiwanese slang)!


In the twelfth month, my puppy died here.
